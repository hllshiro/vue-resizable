# vue-resizable

A Vue 3 component library for creating resizable areas. Supports flexible combinations and custom styles.

## Features

- üéØ **Intuitive Drag Behavior**: Only adjacent panels are affected when dragging splitters.
- üöÄ **High Precision**: Implements a delta-based, "zero-sum" calculation during drag operations. This approach fundamentally prevents cumulative floating-point errors, making resizing perfectly stable and accurate.
- üîß **Proportional Initialization**: Use the `ratio` prop to define the initial proportional size of panels.
- üì± **Responsive**: Adapts to container size changes automatically.
- üé® **Customizable**: Full control over panel sizing and constraints via CSS (`min-width`/`min-height`).
- üí™ **TypeScript**: Complete type safety out of the box.
- ü™∂ **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size with zero dependencies.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Dynamic Visibility**: Show/hide panels with automatic layout adjustment.

## Architecture

This library uses a modern Flexbox architecture where panel dimensions are controlled by `flex-basis`.

- **Initial Sizing with Ratios**: The `ratio` prop is used to determine the initial distribution of space among panels. On load, the container calculates the appropriate `flex-basis` percentage for each panel based on the sum of all visible panel ratios. After initialization, panel sizes are determined by user-driven resizing.
- **Strict Sizing**: Panels are configured with `flex-grow: 0` and `flex-shrink: 0`. This ensures that the `flex-basis` percentage is strictly respected, preventing unpredictable resizing from the browser's default Flexbox behavior.
- **Stable Drag Mechanics**: When a drag operation begins, all panel sizes are temporarily converted to a stable percentage-based `flex-basis`. The drag then applies a calculated pixel-delta, ensuring that what one panel gains, the adjacent one loses, guaranteeing the total size remains constant and eliminating layout shifts or rounding errors.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hllshiro/vue-resizable
```

**Note**: This library requires Vue 3 as a peer dependency. Make sure you have Vue 3 installed in your project:

```bash
npm install vue@^3.0.0
```

## Vue Version Compatibility

- Vue 3.0.0 and above
- Built with TypeScript for better development experience
- Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript projects

## Usage

### Global Registration

Register all components globally in your main application file:

```javascript
// main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import VueResizable from '@hllshiro/vue-resizable'
import '@hllshiro/vue-resizable/style.css'

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(VueResizable)
app.mount('#app')
```

### Local Registration (Recommended)

Import and use components locally for better tree-shaking:

```javascript
// Component.vue
<script setup>
import { ResizableContainer, ResizablePanel, ResizableSplitter } from '@hllshiro/vue-resizable'
import '@hllshiro/vue-resizable/style.css'
</script>
```

### TypeScript Support

This library is built with TypeScript and provides full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```typescript
// Component.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ResizableContainer, ResizablePanel, ResizableSplitter } from '@hllshiro/vue-resizable'
import type { Component } from 'vue'
import '@hllshiro/vue-resizable/style.css'

// Components are fully typed
const container: Component = ResizableContainer
</script>
```
## API

### ResizableContainer

The main container component that manages the layout of panels and splitters.

**Props:**
- `direction`: `'horizontal' | 'vertical'` - Layout direction

**Features:**
- Automatically initializes panel sizing based on inline styles
- Converts pixel values to appropriate flex properties
- Handles container resize events

### ResizablePanel

A flexible panel that can be resized by adjacent splitters.

**Props:**
- `show`: `boolean` (default: `true`) - Controls panel visibility
- `ratio`: `number` (default: `1`) - Panel size ratio for proportional sizing

**Sizing Behavior:**
- **Ratio-based Initial Sizing**: Use the `ratio` prop to set the initial size of the panel relative to others.
  - Higher `ratio` values get more space allocation on initialization.
- **Dynamic Visibility**: Use the `show` prop to hide/show panels with automatic layout recalculation.

**CSS Properties:**
- `min-width`, `min-height`: Minimum size constraints
- `max-width`, `max-height`: Maximum size constraints (optional)

### ResizableSplitter

A draggable divider that allows users to resize adjacent panels.

**Behavior:**
- Only affects the two immediately adjacent panels
- Automatically handles different panel configurations:
  - **Ratio-based Panels**: Adjusts ratio proportions dynamically
  - **Mixed Configurations**: Seamlessly handles combinations of different panel types
- **Smart Visibility**: Automatically hides when adjacent panels are hidden
- **Precise Calculations**: Employs a delta-based, 'zero-sum' algorithm during dragging. This means the size gained by one panel is precisely the size lost by the other, eliminating cumulative rounding errors and ensuring exceptionally smooth and stable resizing.

**Styling:**
- Default size: 5px width/height
- Hover and active states included
- Fully customizable via CSS
